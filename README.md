# Hacker news App 
It is a simple full responsive hacker news web app made with server side pagination.

This app uses hacker news api and it is different from common hacker news app as it contained an extra feature of sorting news by comments in decreasing order and along with that one can also delete the news that he/she does not want to see at that instance.

User can also request news in accordance with topic of interest by searching through keywords All the styling is done through manual CSS to get hands dirty on it :)
